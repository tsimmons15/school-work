<!--This is the admit page
	The admin page will probably end up getting filled out a lot (especially when we finish the full scheduling capability)
	A first it was just a way to get an over-lord to control the server, sort of
	The original idea was for there to be a single admin
	Since the addition of the admin page, it'll probably be expanded out to be the managers are the admins, so maybe
		change the name of the page to manager?
