# asc-scheduling
The Valencia ASC Scheduling/Leaderboard project
Version 0.7

The structure is as follows:

	/ root
		-	client
			-	lib
		-	html
		-	lib
		-	packages
		-	public
			-	images
		-	server

	The root is the root of the project, the main directory.

		Client stores the code which will run locally on the user's browser.

			No sensitive information should be hard-coded in this folder

			No code in this folder will, at time of launch, have access
				to the database or some specific features, for security reasons
			The client directory should be just .js files.

			Ignore lib, it's used by Bootstrap. Unless you need to modify the .less files

				In which case, do not ignore lib. It's used by Bootstrap.

		Html will store the html templates

			The templates are (roughly) based on their function.

			If you have a better idea for the name of a file, go ahead and change it

				Make sure you update other references...

			I have the default CSS here, because it seemed the right fit.

		Lib is sort of a catch-all for code

			It is neither the server, nor the client, but both.

			Do not assume you have access to any specific piece of data at all times

			Split into two files currently:

				common, which is mainly setting up the databases currently

				routes, which sets up the paging behavior of the website

					Currently using IronRouter

					If you change the name of any templates, make sure you update routes.js

		Packages is for specific packages installed and used by Meteor

			Ignore packages, for the most part

		Public is public

			If/When we get images to upload, they will end up here inside images

				This is necessary for meteor's operation

		Server is the JS server, the heart of Meteor

			The code ran here has implicit security. Code stored here has implicit security, but be mindful of what you store here anyway

			If you try to implement something in the client, and it fails due to permissions you will have to write a method or service on the Server

			If you cannot find code on the client, try looking in the Server

				Especially if it deals with the database or User settings
				

Meteor stores everything using MongoDB, a JSON encoded database

The structure of the user database is below:

	/	The root of the database
		- User 					A registered use
			- username			The user's username
			- password			The user's password
			- profile			The meat of the user's profile
				- games played 	The number of the games played
				- department 	The department code for the center the employee works, in the case of multiple depts., their main/first department
				- rank			The rank of the user after a game
				- skill 			An array of two numbers: [the current skill ranking of the user, the confidence the system has in the ranking]

Each user in the database follows this pattern

This is by no means a finished description of the user

For one, we need to add their email address, their first/last name, a location of their picture, a system for getting their desired hours, and whatever else the system will end up becoming...

The basic structure will survive:

	- stuff that is basic/necessary for Meteor.Accounts to function will be children of the User
	- stuff that is not necessary for Meteor.Accounts, things specific to this application, will end up in Profile

The reason for this is that Meteor.Accounts resists letting us add to the root easily. Profile is the only thing we have real control over the structure of
